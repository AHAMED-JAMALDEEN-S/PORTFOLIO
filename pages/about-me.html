    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am Ahamed Jamaldeen and would like to be called ‘Jamal’. I am from Trichy, Tamil Nadu, India.</p>
    <h3>2017 - 2019</h3>
    <p>I remember during my high school, the only subject I was interested in was computer science.
     Not that I hate all other subjects, but it was the only subject that I could understand fully. 
     Even solving small problems (addition of two numbers, etc.) gave me huge satisfaction. 
     That was when I decided that this had to be my career, and 
     I want to enjoy the satisfaction of solving problems till I retire.</p>
     <h3>2019 - 2023</h3>
     <p>Then I went to college, choosing my favourite subject as my career path, dreaming of getting the same satisfaction 
      which I got during my school life. But then COVID hit; everything went online—my classes, semester exams—and 
      I completed almost 50% of my degree online without even knowing the context. 
      When we returned to college during the 6th semester, the placements had already started. 
      Almost 90% of my class got placed at the end of college, and I was in the remaining 10%. 
      I completed my degree without any knowledge or skills, and all I had was myself to blame.</p>
    <h3>2023 - 2024</h3>
    <p>
        This was the hardest phase of my life, where I had a degree without any skills. 
        Wherever there were hirings, almost 2,000 to 3,000 people showed up for close to 15 vacancies, 
        and I could not even go past the initial round. So, I decided to start everything from scratch, 
        started building technical skills by doing small projects. Finally, after almost a year of 
        hard work and patience, I got my first offer in Trichy.
