    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <h3>2017 - 2019</h3>
    <p>  During my high school, computer science was the one subject that truly resonated with me. I didn’t dislike the others,
         but this was the only field I could completely understand and genuinely enjoy. Even solving the simplest 
         problems gave me a sense of accomplishment. 
         That feeling of satisfaction made me realize that problem-solving through code was what I wanted to
         pursue for the rest of my life.

     <h3>2019 - 2023</h3>
     <p>
        When I entered college, I chose computer science with the hope of continuing that same passion and excitement.
        However, the pandemic changed everything. Classes and examinations moved online, and a significant portion of 
        my degree was completed without proper context or hands-on learning. By the time we returned to campus, 
        placement drives had already begun. While most of my classmates secured jobs, I was among the few who didn’t.
        I graduated realizing that I lacked both confidence and practical skills, and there was no one else to hold 
        responsible but myself.

    <h3>2023 - 2024</h3>
    <p>
        This phase was the most challenging period of my journey. I had a degree but no real skills to back it up.
        Job openings were scarce, competition was intense, and I struggled to clear even the initial rounds. Instead 
        of giving up, I made the decision to start over from the basics. I began building my technical foundation step 
        by step, working on small projects and learning through consistent practice. With time, patience, and perseverance,
        my efforts paid off, and I finally secured my first role as a software professional in Trichy.
